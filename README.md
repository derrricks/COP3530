COP3530 - Projects for Data Structures

# Project 1 -  Array Searches and Sorts:
  
  - Data is read in from a file (Countries1.csv) and stored in Country objects, which are stored in a Country array.
  - Implements Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Bubble Sort
  - Implements Binary Search and Sequential Search


 # Project 2 - Stacks and Priority Queues: 
 
  - Data is read in from a file (Countries2.csv) and stored in Country objects, which are stored in different Priority Queues based on their COVID-19 CFR (case fatality rating). The countries are then pushed to a Stack in a certain order
  - Implements Stack and Priority Queue Data Structures


 # Project 3 - Linked Lists: 

  - Data is read in from a file (Countries3.csv) and stored in Country objects, which are stored in a Queue and Stack. The Stack and Queue make use of Linked List to store and track the data
  - Implements a double-ended singly linked list Stack Data Structure
  - Implements a double-ended doubly linked list Queue Data Structure

 # Project 4 - Binary Search Trees: 

  -  Data is read in from a file (Countries4.csv) and stored in Country objects, which are stored in a Binary Search Tree.
  -  Implements a Binary Search Tree Data Structure including methods such as inserting, deleting, searching, traversing, and finding the top twenty/bottom twenty elements

 # Project 5 - Hash Tables: 

  -  Data is read in from a file (Countries5.csv) and stored in Country objects, which are stored in a Hash Table
  -  Implements a Hash Table Data Structure including methods such as hashing, inserting, deleting, printing, and finding collsions free cells.
